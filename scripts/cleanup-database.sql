-- ðŸ§¹ COMPLETE DATABASE CLEANUP SCRIPT
-- This script will delete ALL user accounts and related data
-- Use with caution - this is irreversible!

-- BACKUP NOTICE: Make sure to backup important data before running this script

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 1: DELETE DATA IN CORRECT ORDER (respecting foreign key constraints)
-- =============================================================================

-- Delete deliverables first (references milestones)
DELETE FROM deliverables;
RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted all deliverables';

-- Delete payouts (references deals)
DELETE FROM payouts;
RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted all payouts';

-- Delete milestones (references deals)
DELETE FROM milestones;

-- Delete contracts (references deals)
DELETE FROM contracts;

-- Delete disputes (references deals and users)
DELETE FROM disputes;

-- Delete deals (references projects and users)
DELETE FROM deals;

-- Delete projects (references users)

-- Delete user events (but keep system events for audit trail)

-- This requires special handling as it's in the auth schema
-- =============================================================================

-- Delete all users from auth.users (this will cascade to other auth tables)
DELETE FROM auth.users;
